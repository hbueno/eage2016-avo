\begin{abstract}
Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) inversion provides
estimates of the P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity and density of
the stratified medium. A global optimization technique was
selected for the inversion due to the multi-parametric behaviour
of the AVO inversions which are strongly affected by the initial
estimate of the model rock properties.  An analysis to verify
the dependency between P-wave, S-wave velocity and density in
the recovered parameters was also performed using empirical
relations as constraints. In inversion schemes, the forward
modelling is often the most time consuming process. To reduce
computation time, we have implemented a genetic algorithm and a
\textit{table-based} ray-theory algorithm to allow us to
implement a large amount of models in the global search. Our
results show that the genetic algorithm was capable to recover
the physical parameters with good agreement for the examples
using the empirical constraints, but was also capable of
converging to solutions which were far from the correct answer,
but were good answers to explain the observed dataset. The
forward modelling algorithm has shown excellent performance to
be used in global optimization schemes allowing the use of a
large number of members in the population of the genetic
algorithm.

\section{Introduction}
The methodology of AVO has been widely used in the industry as a
direct hydrocarbon indicator. In order to provide a quantitative
interpretation, AVO inversion to the rock properties has been
exploited. In forward model, the computation of the reflection
amplitude as a function of incident angle (offset) is
classically attributed to \cite{Zoeppritz1919} and
\cite{Knott1899} for plane waves. For the reverse model,
\cite{Rosa1976} derived and verified the ill-posed nature of the
inversion of Zoeppritz equations for rock properties, meaning
that we have multiple combinations of input to produce the same
output.  Moreover, \cite{Stoffa1991}, \cite{Mallick1995} and
others suggest global optimization schemes to treat the AVO
inversion due to its multi-parametric formulation which implies
a very complex solution space with many local minima, which
makes it difficult to find correct solutions. However, the
process of global optimizations requires many forward models
which increase considerably the time of computation. Many of the
works published in literature use forward modelling algorithms
based on the wave equation, which demands great computational
power. This study is based on the premise that unconsolidated
sediments with small rock-property changes between layers can be
modeled with ray theory without a loss of resolution. For
computational ease we have developed a forward modeling
algorithm called \textit{table-based ray theory} in order to
speed up the computation of synthetics seismograms for global
optimization.  The genetic algorithm was based on findings of
\cite{Stoffa1991} and \cite{Sen1992} and used the
\cite{Gardner1974} and \cite{Castagna1985} empirical
relationships as constrains to verify the dependency among the
parameters.

\section{Synthetic common-midpoint seismogram: forward
modelling} 

The forward modelling algorithm implemented is the
\textit{table-based ray tracing}. The Earth model assumed is the
isotropic layer model where the parametric equations are
used to compute the two-way traveltimes and offset as a function
of a constant ray parameter \citep{Slotnick1959}, the
equations are given by
%!
\begin{eqnarray} x & = & 2\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {h_{i}pv_{i}} {(1
		- p^{2}v_{i}^{2})^{1/2}} \ ,\label{eq.x} \\ t & = &
		2\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {h_{i}} {v_{i}(1 -
		p^{2}v_{i}^{2})^{1/2}} \ , \label{eq.t} \end{eqnarray}
%
where $h_{i}$, $v_{i}$ and $p$ are, respectively, the
layer thickness, velocity and ray parameter which is
defined by
%!
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{\sin(\theta_{i})}{v_{i}}\ ,\label{eq.p}
\end{equation}
%!
where $\theta_i$ is the angle between the seismic ray and the
vertical in the $i$-th layer. Using a sonic log or other
vertical velocity information, three different
two-dimensional tables (\textit{offset, traveltime and
reflection coefficient}) are built starting with equations
\ref{eq.x} and \ref{eq.t}.

To start the process, the P-wave velocity as a function of depth
is transformed to time. The same applies to the S-wave velocity
and density. For the 2D traveltime table, there are 90 columns
associated with the ray parameter when the incident angle in the
first medium varies from $0^{\circ}$ to $89^{\circ}$. The rows are
associated with the $t_{o}$ times in increments of the time
sample interval. Now, the 2D tables for offset and traveltime
can easily be determined using equations \ref{eq.x} and
\ref{eq.t} respectively. Since the velocity function is sampled
in equal increments of the sample rate the same way the 2D
tables are, the computation of the incident angle for each cell
in the 2D table is possible with equation \ref{eq.p}. With the
incident angle known, the next step is to compute the 2D table
of reflection coefficients at each interface. This was
accomplished with Shuey's approximation \citep{Shuey1985} given by
%!
\begin{equation}
R_{P} (\phi) = A + B\sin^{2}(\theta) + C\sin^{2}(\theta)\tan^{2}(\theta)
\ , \label{eq.shuey}
\end{equation}
%!
where $\phi$ is the incident angle, $\theta$ is the average of
the incident and transmitted angles, and the terms $A$, $B$ and
$C$ are defined as
%?!
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A & = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\triangle V_{P}}{V_{P}}     +
\frac{\triangle \rho}{\rho}     \right)\ , \\
B & = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\triangle V_{P}}{V_{P}}  - 2\left(\frac{
V_{S}}{V_{P}}\right)^{2}  \left(\frac{2\triangle V_{S}}{V_{S}} +
\frac{\triangle \rho}{\rho}\right)   \ , \\
C & = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\triangle V_{P}}{V_{P}} \right) \ .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%!
In these expressions, $\triangle V_{P} = V_{P2} - V_{P1}$,
$\triangle V_{S} = V_{S2} - V_{S1}$, $\triangle \rho = \rho_{2}
- \rho_{1}$, where $V_{P}$, $V_{S}$ and $\rho$ are arithmetic
averages for P-wave and S-wave velocities and the density.

Finally, in order to build the common-midpoint (CMP) synthetic
seismogram, we define which are the offsets to model and start a
search row-by-row inside the \textit{offset table} looking for
the requested offsets.  Once the cell is found for the specified
offset, we go into the same cell position inside the
\textit{traveltime} and \textit{reflectivity tables} to place
the reflection coefficient from that position in the correct
time arrival inside the trace.

The algorithm is simple and provides the opportunity to be
easily adapted to study more complex effects such as the stretch
in normal moveout (NMO) correction, NMO without stretch
(ray-trace NMO correction), array effects which affect the
amplitude of the wave received by the streamer, easily
extraction of AVO attributes, polar anisotropic media, etc.

The genetic algorithm (Figure~\ref{fig.fluxo}) is a technique
used to perform global optimizations based on the natural
selection process \citep{Holland1975}. In order to simulate this
process, the algorithm constantly modifies the initial
pseudo-random population in order to reach local minima
positions.  Initially, each member of the pseudo-random
population is a potential solution to the problem and after some
iterations the genetic algorithm guides the population to
the best fit positions.

The algorithm needs to \textit{select} a percentage of the
population to start the reproduction scheme where the
\textit{crossover} and the \textit{mutation} are the two classic
techniques to exchange genetic information between the members
and also randomly change the genetic information to provide
exploration of the solution space. In order to select the
members of the population we need to measure the fitness between
each potential solution and the data we want to optimize. The
objective function used was proposed by \cite{Porsani2000} and
is given by
%!
\begin{equation}
h = \frac{2y^{T} x} {y^{T}y + x^{T}x} \ ,
\label{eq.Porsani}
\end{equation}
%!
where, $x$ and $y$ are respectively the observed data and
modelled data in the time domain and  $x^{T}$, $y^{T}$ are their
transposes. In order to constrain the inverse problem due to the
dependency between S-wave velocity and density with P-wave
velocity, weused the Gardner \citep{Gardner1974} and
Castagna \citep{Castagna1985} relations to write S-wave and
density as a function of P-wave.

\section{Results}
A synthetic model was used in order to verify the global
optimization method for AVO inversion and its relationships with
the prior information (\cite{Gardner1974} and
\cite{Castagna1985} constraints) and also to analyze the
performance of the forward modelling algorithm proposed. The
physical parameters for a simple synthetic model are described
in the Table~\ref{tab.model}. The thickness between the two
inner layers was chosen to be small enough to allow interaction
between the wavelets.

The parameters used in the forward modelling was a zero-phase
Ricker wavelet with central frequency in 40~Hz and time sample
rate of 2~ms. In order to perform the global optimization the
CMP gathers are NMO corrected with the $V_{p}$ function of the
random model.
%!
The parameters used in the \textit{genetic algorithm} are given
by a \textit{selection rate} of $50\%$, $P_{mutation}$~=~0.1,
$P_{update}$~=~0.47, $P_{crossover}$~=~0.90,~1000 members in the
population and a convergence criterion of 200 iterations.

In the following results only the parameters from the fourth
layer of the model in Table~\ref{tab.model} are shown in more
detail. Figure~\ref{fig2} shows the evolution of the genetic
algorithm solutions for the P-wave velocity parameter in the
fourth layer when running with and without the
\cite{Gardner1974} and \cite{Castagna1985} constraints. As we
can see in Figure~\ref{fig2-with}, after a few iterations the
algorithm is already guiding all the members in the population
close to the correct position in the solution space.
%!
However, Figure~\ref{fig2-without} shows that even with the
lack of additional constraints to restrict the solutions, the
algorithm is leading the population to particular solutions
which are not too close to the correct one but are good answers
to the objective function of the inverse problem as we can see in
Table~\ref{tab.recovered}.

In Table~\ref{tab.recovered} we can see the values for the best
model recovered with and without the constrains in the
parameters. The algorithm generated 301.000 forward synthetics in
30 minutes. Even with more than $20\%$ of relative error in
average, the best model recovered without the constrains still
produce a very similar CMP gather as we can verify by the
correlation coefficient value.

\section{Conclusions}
The forward modelling algorithm presented has shown excellent
potential to be used in global optimization schemes by providing
good performance with restricted computer power. The constraints
are helpful in reaching the correct global minimum however the
result without constraints indicate that we can still converge
to incorrect results that satisfy the objective function. In our
future research, the genetic algorithm will be formulated inside
the Bayesian framework to provide solid statistical information
about the distribution of the solutions during the iterations.
It is expected to be able to visualize distinguishable
concentration of particular solutions which could be useful to
determine possible scenarios for the recovered parameters.
Finally, for future work in this project will also introduce
errors in the models and an application to real data to verify
the reliability of this technique.
