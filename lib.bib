  Abstract                 = {The reflection and transmission coefficients for vertical incidence can be very closely approximated by computing the direct-reflected and the direct-transmitted portion for transition layers, and letting the thickness approach zero. The same procedure can then be applied to the general case of oblique incidence, which yields approximate values of the respective coefficients, including those of the converted waves. The approximate values compare well with the exact values calculated by Muskat and Meres (1940).These approximations might be adequate for all cases occurring in reflection seismic prospecting. They can also be used, possibly even more profitably, for the derivation of some rules governing the reflection process. The influence of Poisson's ratio can be read more or less directly from the approximate formulas. All converted waves depend primarily on the ratio of the shear velocities.},

  Abstract                 = {The main objective of the AVO inversion is to obtain posterior distributions for P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity and density from specified prior distributions, seismic data and well-log data. The inversion problem also involves estimation of a seismic wavelet and the seismic-noise level. The noise model is represented by a zero mean Gaussian distribution specified by a covariance matrix. A method for joint AVO inversion, wavelet estimation and estimation of the noise level is developed in a Bayesian framework. The stochastic model includes uncertainty of both the elastic parameters, the wavelet, and the seismic and well-log data. The posterior distribution is explored by Markov-chain Monte-Carlo simulation using the Gibbs' sampler algorithm. The inversion algorithm has been tested on a seismic line from the Heidrun Field with two wells located on the line. The use of a coloured seismic-noise model resulted in about 10% lower uncertainties for the P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity and density compared with a white-noise model. The uncertainty of the estimated wavelet is low. In the Heidrun example, the effect of including uncertainty of the wavelet and the noise level was marginal with respect to the AVO inversion results.},

These data demonstrate simple systematic relationships between compressional and shear wave velocities. For water-saturated clastic silicate rocks, shear wave velocity is approximately linearly related to compressional wave velocity and the compressional-to-shear velocity ratio decreases with increasing compressional velocity. Laboratory data for dry sandstones indicate a nearly constant compressional-to-shear velocity ratio with rigidity approximately equal to bulk modulus. Ideal models for regular packings of spheres and cracked solids exhibit behavior similar to the observed water-saturated and dry trends. For dry rigidity equal to dry bulk modulus, Gassmann's equations predict velocities in close agreement with data from the water-saturated rock.},

  Abstract                 = {A multiplicity of factors influence seismic reflection coefficients and the observed gravity of typical sedimentary rocks. Rock velocity and density depend upon the mineral composition and the granular nature of the rock matrix, cementation, porosity, fluid content, and environmental pressure. Depth of burial and geologic age also have an effect.Lithology and porosity can be related empirically to velocity by the time-average equation. This equation is most reliable when the rock is under substantial pressure, is saturated with brine, and contains well-cemented grains. For very low porosity rocks under large pressures, the mineral composition can be related to velocity by the theories of Voigt and Reuss.One effect of pressure variation on velocity results from the opening or closing of microcracks. For porous sedimentary rocks, only the difference between overburden and fluid pressure affects the microcrack system. Existing theory does not take into account the effect of microcrack closure on the elastic behavior of rocks under pressure or the chemical interaction between water and clay particles.The theory of Gassmann can be used to calculate the effect of different saturating fluids on the P-wave velocity of porous rocks. The effect may be large enough in shallow, recent sediments to permit gas sands to be distinguished from water sands on seismic records. At depths greater than about 6000 ft, however, the reflection coefficient becomes essentially independent of the nature of the fluid.Data show the systematic relationship between velocity and density in sedimentary rocks. As a result, reflection coefficients can often be estimated satisfactorily from velocity information alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Many optical or image processing tasks reduce to the optimization of some set of parameters. Genetic algorithms can optimize these parameters even when the functions they map are fairly complicated, but they can only do so the point where the fitness functions they are given can differentiate between good results and the best result. This can occur when the optimal point is in a region (in a three dimensional example) such as a plateau, where all the surrounding points are of very nearly the same fitness. If there are multiple peaks in close proximity, all of nearly the same fitness but with very deep divides, the algorithm will have trouble 'hopping' from one to the other. One way to overcome these obstacles is to scale the fitness values given by the fitness function, thereby gently modifying the fitness function from the point of view of the algorithm, thus rewarding the more fit solutions to a higher precision than would naturally occur. Four such scaling methods will be compared based upon their handling of a sample set of optical processing data. Success will be determined by comparing the variance over time, selection pressure over time, and best of generation graphs.},

  Abstract                 = {Seismic waveform inversion is one of many geophysical problems which can be identified as a nonlinear multiparameter optimization problem. Methods based on local linearization fail if the starting model is too far from the true model. We have investigated the applicability of 'Genetic Algorithms' (GA) to the inversion of plane-wave seismograms. Like simulated annealing, genetic algorithms use a random walk in model space and a transition probability rule to help guide their search. However, unlike a single simulated annealing run, the genetic algorithms search from a randomly chosen population of models (strings) and work with a binary coding of the model parameter set. Unlike a pure random search, such as in a 'Monte Carlo' method, the search used in genetic algorithms is not directionless. Genetic algorithms essentially consist of three operations, selection, crossover, and mutation, which involve random number generation, string copies, and some partial string exchanges. The choice of the initial population, the probabilities of crossover and mutation are crucial for the practical implementation of the algorithm. We investigated the effects of these parameters in the inversion of plane-wave seismograms in which a normalized crosscorrelation function was used as the objective or fitness function (E). We also introduce the concept of 'update' probability to control the influence of past generations. The combination of a low value of mutation probability ( approximately 0.01), a moderate value of the crossover probability ( approximately 0.6) and a high value of update probability ( approximately 0.9) are found to be optimal for the convergence of the algorithm. Further, we show that concepts from simulated annealing can be used effectively for the stretching of the fitness function which helps in the convergence of the algorithm. Thus, we propose to use exp (E/T) rather than E as the fitness function, where T (analogous to temperature in simulated annealing) is a properly chosen parameter which can change slowly with each generation. Also, by repeating the GA optimization procedure several times with different randomly chosen initial model populations, we derive 'a very good subset' of models from the entire model space and calculate the a posteriori probability density sigma (m) varies as exp (E(m)/T). The sigma (m)'s are then used to calculate a 'mean' model, which is found to be close to the true model.},
